# README

A bootloader for the STM32F103CC (name for a fake from china).  
Based on the usb_dfu for Lisa-M-1 in opencm3-examples [1].  
Needs libopencm3.  

The bootloader waits a little bit for download to happen, than it starts the application.  
For download use dfu-util with the wait option [2] or stm32FWupgrade.

For Windows WinUSB drivers from zadig are needed.  
The firmware needs to start from APP_ADDRESS.
